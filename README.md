## Overview

The goal of this repository is to create and maintain execution environments for all supported platforms for the community collections. The resulting contaners can be used for consistant development and testing.
This repository should also help to provide recipes to create containers that can be used and maintained by your e.g. in production.
It is planned to create exeution environments with supported ansible versions, python versions on SUSE Leap and Centos

## Requirememts

you need a working podman installation on MacOS, or Linux x86_64.

## Use with ansible-navigator
Create the file `${HOME}/.ansible-navigator.yml` as a default or a `file ansible-navigator.yml` in the root directory of your project with the following content (adapt to your needs):

```[yaml]
---
ansible-navigator:
  execution-environment:
    container-engine: podman
    # Passe diesen Pfad zu deinem Container-Image an
    image: ghcr.io/your-org/sap-ee:latest
    pull:
      # LÃ¤dt das Image nur herunter, wenn es lokal nicht vorhanden ist
      policy: missing
    # next lines are optional to pass variable directory
    volume-mounts:
      - src: "./vars"       # directory on host-system
        dest: "/vars"       # target directory in container
```

ansible-navigator will pick this file on the next execution and automatically runs the playbook in this container

## Use with ansible-playbook directly

```bash
podman run --name sap-ee -v ${yourworkdir}:/runner:Z -ti ghcr.io/sap-linuxlab/sap-ee:latest
ansible --version
```

## Maintained images

The execution environments are multi-arch images build for arm64 and amd64 archtectures. (ppc64le is planned)

- ghcr.io/sap-linuxlab/sap-ee:latest        contains the latest collections as published on galaxy.ansible.com
- ghcr.io/sap-linuxlab/sap-ee:latest-dev    contains latest sap collections from sap-linuxlab dev-branch and other latest published collections from galaxy.ansible.com

All other execution environments are tagged with `[dev]YYMMDD`. For a complete list see [github packages](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/ansible.executionenvironment/pkgs/container/sap-ee)

## TODO

1. add ppcle platform
2. add suse leap as base image

## Build your own customized MultiArch Build environment for consistent testing

If you just want to use the maintained execution environments you can stop reading here.
Continue reading if you want to create your own customized execution environments.

## Run your development container

The easiest way to create a build environment is to use the community ansible build environment.
If you do not want to use that, feel free to create your own build environment.

1. Clone this repository to your local filesystem

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/ansible.executionenvironment
   ```

2. Change to the root of the cloned repo and remember the path

   ```bash
   cd ansible.executionenvironment
   ee_dir=$(pwd)
   ```

3. Start the build environment

   ```bash
   podman run --privileged --name ansible_dev -ti -v ${ee_dir}:/workdir ghcr.io/ansible/community-ansible-dev-tools
   ```

>[!NOTE]
> The base image used is currently only available for x86_64 and arm.
>
> The procedure has only been tested on MacOS yet.

## Create the execution environment

To create a SAP EE with galaxy collections only run the following command:

```bash
ansible-builder create -v3 [-f execution-environment.yml]
```

<!--
Add the following line to the created Containerfile to connect to your repo, if you host on ghcr.io and do not create the image in a workflow:

```bash
LABEL TBD org....
```
-->

For easier copy and paste set the variable `sap_ee_container` to the name of your final container, e.g.:

```bash
sap_ee_container='ghcr.io/sap-linuxlab/sap-ee:latest'
```

This following commands creates the multiarch manifest and cross build the execution environments:

```bash
podman manifest create ${sap_ee_container}
podman build --platform linux/arm64 --layers=false --manifest ${sap_ee_container} --tag sap_ee_arm64 -f context/Containerfile context
podman build --platform linux/amd64 --layers=false --manifest ${sap_ee_container} --tag sap_ee_amd64 -f context/Containerfile context
podman build --platform linux/ppc64le --layers=false --manifest ${sap_ee_container} --tag sap_ee_ppc64le -f context/Containerfile context
```

After building check the manifest

```bash
podman manifest inspect ${sap_ee_container} | grep arch
```

Example Output:

```json
{
    "schemaVersion": 2,
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json",
    "manifests": [
        {
            "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
            "size": 913,
            "digest": "sha256:35786bff9b3a96e5fa18ebd368623886d235015317ae27c7427671e5bf8da6d0",
            "platform": {
                "architecture": "amd64",
                "os": "linux"
            }
        },
        {
            "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
            "size": 913,
            "digest": "sha256:d485c5c2ac5ed42d5248af1274f7c04b414993c3e10ec8dc2aec899c4cab1fe6",
            "platform": {
                "architecture": "arm64",
                "os": "linux"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Now login to the registry and upload to the multiarch containerfile, e.g.

```bash
podman login
podman manifest push ${sap_ee_container}
```

For the podman login command use your github username with a personal access token.

>[!NOTE]
> *Known Bug:* When building on Apple Silcon the images are all get the variant v8 detected in the images.
> It's not annotated in the manifest or image, but when executing such an image you will get the error message:
> `WARNING: image platform (linux/amd64/v8) does not match the expected platform (linux/amd64)`
> It can be safely ignored

# Changes for building supported EE for RHAAP

If you want to add supported Automation Hub content, get your Automation Hub token from [here](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token) and export it in the environment variable `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_RH_CERTIFIED_REPO_TOKEN`, login to `registry.redhat.io` with your RedHat credentials and run the following commands:

```bash
export ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_RH_CERTIFIED_REPO_TOKEN=_your token_
podman login registry.redhat.io
ansible-builder build -v 3 \
  --tag myregistry/sap-rh-ee:version \
  --build-arg ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_RH_CERTIFIED_REPO_TOKEN \
  -f execution-environment-rh.yml
```
